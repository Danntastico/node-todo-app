# NodeJS ToDo Application!

This is one of my firsts practices with nodeJS!

Here I made a to do application using [yargs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yargs) to build the interactive command line.

## Installation

Just clone this repo and run the command

```bash
  //npm
 npm install
```

## Process!

1. First, create the `config` file where I put the different configurations to the commands that I need to create.

2. create a main file where I call my config yargs file and start to proove with the commands that I'm Running
